A test of a data clean pipeline for a larger scale prospective cohort (no purpose of pubilciation)
**mice** package (https://github.com/amices/mice) and **VIM** package (https://github.com/statistikat/VIM) to analyze missing values in multivariate data
**extremevalues** package (https://github.com/markvanderloo/extremevalues) for outlier detection. I optimized the workflow of this package to enable batch processing of multiple continuous variablesâ€”automating analysis, visualization, and missing value handling for each variable. 
R v4.4.0.
